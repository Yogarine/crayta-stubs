--- Locator is a physical entity which doesn't render anything but can have its position and rotation
--- queried.
---
--- It can be used as a start location for spawning (see SpawnPlayer) Locator derives from Entity so if
--- you have a Locator you can do any of these functions as well as the functions in Entity. You can do
--- entity:IsA(Locator) to see if a particular entity variable is a Locator type entity.
